# Agent Johnny5

A minimalistic multi-agent system where specialized agents perform specific tasks and are orchestrated by a main agent.

## System Architecture

-   **Main Agent (Orchestrator)**: Acts as the central coordinator, receives prompts and routes them to the appropriate specialized agent
-   **Specialized Agents**: Each agent has a specific purpose and expertise:
    -   **PullSage**: Provides wisdom about pull requests (currently just returns a greeting)
    -   More agents to be added...

## Getting Started

1. Set up the environment:

    ```
    python scripts/setup.py
    ```

2. Add your API keys to the `.env` file:

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

3. Run the multi-agent system using one of these methods:

    ```
    # Run as a standalone script
    python scripts/run_agents.py

    # Run as a FastAPI development server
    python scripts/dev.py

    # Test the ADK integration
    python test_agent.py


    # Run with ADK web interface
    cd agents
    adk web
    ```

## Extending the System

To add a new agent:

1. Create a new directory in the `agents/` folder
2. Implement your agent class extending the base `Agent` class
3. The Main Agent will automatically discover and load your agent
